SoundCloud Master is a light weight and shiny clean code wordpress plugin WIDGET that you need to show off and sell your music.


== Description ==

SoundCloud is the new music network on the block that allows users to create, record and share sounds and music with family, friends and the world. SoundClound Master was specially built for wordpress in iframe and integrates perfectly in any widget position and template color scheme.

These are the main options we packed into this extension. SoundCloud player is able to play single tracks or full user music sets... nothing better than a nice music playlist, full control over player width and height, full control over color scheme, display the track or music set artwork and, auto-play.

Easy and intuitive to use. Check the screenshots.
